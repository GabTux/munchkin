# Munchkin

### Introduction

Welcome to the Munchkin Card Game Project! This repository contains a C++ implementation of a card game based on the original [Munchkin card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(card_game)) using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library. 

<b>Note</b>: The project was created long ago as a learning exercise to gain experience in C++ programming and game development with SDL from scratch.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- SDL Library: You must install SDL to compile and run this project.
- C++ Compiler: You'll need a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to build the project.

### Getting Started

1) <b>Clone the repository:</b>
```
git clone https://github.com/GabTux/munchkin.git
```
2) <b>Build the project:</b>
```
cd munchkin
make
```
3) <b>Run the game:</b>
```
./munchkin
```

 You can play against a real opponent or a computer-controlled opponent.
